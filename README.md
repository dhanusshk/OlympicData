# Olympic Data Analysis and Visualization Project

## Objective
The goal of this project is to analyze and visualize Olympic data using Azure services and Power BI. The project involves importing, processing, and transforming Olympic data stored in Azure, and then creating insightful visualizations using Power BI.

## Technologies Used
- **Azure Storage Account:**
  - Set up an Azure Storage Account to store Olympic datasets, providing scalable and secure storage.

- **Azure Databricks:**
  - Utilized Azure Databricks for data processing and transformation, leveraging the power of Apache Spark for efficient data manipulation and cleaning.

- **Azure Synapse Analytics (formerly SQL Data Warehouse):**
  - Loaded processed data into Azure Synapse Analytics for structured querying, allowing seamless integration with Power BI.

- **Power BI:**
  - Connected Power BI to Azure Synapse Analytics for visualizing Olympic data. Utilized Power Query for additional data transformations.

## Query Languages
- Employed SQL for data querying within Azure Synapse Analytics.
- Used Power Query M language for additional transformations in Power BI.

## Project Steps
### Data Collection:
- Obtained Olympic datasets containing athlete, event, and medal count information, storing them in Azure Storage Account.

### Data Processing with Azure Databricks:
- Set up an Azure Databricks workspace.
- Imported Olympic datasets into Databricks.
- Used Apache Spark for data cleaning, transformation, and feature engineering.

### Loading Processed Data into Azure Synapse Analytics:
- Configured and loaded processed data into Azure Synapse Analytics, enabling high-performance querying.

### Power BI Data Connection:
- Connected Power BI to Azure Synapse Analytics to establish a live connection to Olympic data.

### Data Visualization in Power BI:
- Designed interactive dashboards and reports in Power BI to visualize key insights.
- Created visualizations like bar charts, maps, and time series plots showcasing trends, medal distributions, and performance comparisons.

### Data Exploration and Insights:
- Explored data using Power BI to uncover trends and patterns in Olympic performance over the years.
- Gained insights into countries' medal counts, popular sports, and athletes' achievements.

### Sharing and Collaboration:
- Shared Power BI reports and dashboards with stakeholders for collaborative decision-making.

## Conclusion
This project successfully demonstrated the end-to-end process of importing, processing, and visualizing Olympic data using Azure services and Power BI. The combination of Azure Databricks, Azure Synapse Analytics, and Power BI provided a scalable, efficient, and user-friendly environment for data analysis and visualization.

The project not only showcased technical skills in Azure and Power BI but also provided valuable insights into historical Olympic data, contributing to a better understanding of sports analytics.
